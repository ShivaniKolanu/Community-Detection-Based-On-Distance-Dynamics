# Community-Detection-Based-On-Distance-Dynamics


This project code file is a ipynb extension file written in Python Langauge.
Our team has used Google Colab to do the project.

It uses the following libraries:

1. networkx
2. math
3. matplotlib
4. numpy
5. sklearn
6. urllib
7. io
8. zipfile


Referred into https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/auto_examples/graph/plot_karate_club.html to import the Karate Club Graph
Referred to https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/auto_examples/graph/plot_football.html to use footbal dataset in the project.


Implemented all the functions of the project in the file NetworkScience_Project.ipyb file except the importing of datasets. Used the above references for it.


If you are executing the code in Google Colab or Jupyter, you dont need to install the libraries. Else, you'll be needing to install them using pip in your local machine.
